## 📘 Course Title
**Hysteresis-Based Modeling and Control of Piezoelectric Actuators for Precision Manipulation**

Winter School 2026 — Invited Lecture

---

## 📖 Overview

Piezoelectric actuators are widely used in precision manipulation due to their high resolution and bandwidth. However, their performance is strongly affected by intrinsic hysteresis nonlinearities, which may degrade accuracy or compromise closed-loop stability if not properly addressed.

This repository contains all lecture materials for the Winter School 2026 course on hysteresis modeling and control, including:

- Classical and generalized Bouc–Wen models  
- Dahl hysteresis model  
- Hysteresis-aware control strategies  
- Interactive simulation tools  
- Lecture slides and reference papers  

The goal is to provide a unified modeling and control perspective for precision piezoelectric actuation and nonlinear systems with hysteresis.
